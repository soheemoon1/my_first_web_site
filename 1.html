<p><strong>Trent John Alexander-Arnold</strong> (born 7 October 1998) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club <strong><u>Liverpool</u></strong> and the England national team. Known for his range of passing and providing assists, he is regarded as one of the best right-backs in world football.</p>
<p>Alexander-Arnold joined Liverpool's academy in 2004 and captained the club across its youth levels. He made his senior debut in 2016, at age 18, and played in back-to-back UEFA Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, winning the latter, and being named in the <strong>Champions League Squad of the Season.</strong> These appearances made Alexander-Arnold the youngest player to start in consecutive finals in the competition. In the same year, he won <strong>the UEFA Super Cup</strong> and <strong>the FIFA Club World Cup.</strong> In domestic football, he won <strong>the 2019–20 PFA Young Player of the Year</strong> and the inaugural Premier League Young Player of the Season awards, has twice been named in the PFA Team of the Year, and helped end <u>Liverpool's 30-year league title drought by winning the 2019–20 Premier League.</u></p>
